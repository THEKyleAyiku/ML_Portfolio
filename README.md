# ML_Portfolio
This portfolio is specifically for my senior-level college course entitled "Introduction to Machine Learning."

## Overview of Machine Learning
The Overview_of_ML PDF can be [found here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) for more details on what machine learning precisely is, how to utilize ML methods, and how my personal curiosity in this field will prepare me for what the future lies ahead of me as a Data Science major.

## C++ Data Exploration
You can find my attempt of the C++ Data Exploration [code here](data_exploration.cpp) and the [document here](Assignment_1.pdf).

## Linear Models
Linear regression is a technique which is utilized for predictions for variables which are based off of other variables. More information on how to utilize linear regression given a data set can be [found here](Regression.pdf) using the statistically designed language, R. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes on the other hand are not really regression algorithms, but are actually classification techniques as the target variables are qualitative and not quantitative. My rendition of an instance of what Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are can be [located here](Classification.pdf), with R being utilized again.

## C++ Algorithms from Scratch
I feel as though that C++ heavily inspired R to where the language is today. So during my class, I collaborated with a partner to code not one, but two C++ algorithms for Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Our attempt for the algorithms are located [code here](naive.cpp) and [more code here](logreg.cpp). Additionally, the document write up can be located [here](Assignment_4.pdf).
