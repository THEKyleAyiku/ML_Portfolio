# ML_Portfolio
This portfolio is specifically for my senior-level college course entitled "Introduction to Machine Learning."

## Overview of Machine Learning
The Overview_of_ML PDF can be [found here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) for more details on what machine learning precisely is, how to utilize ML methods, and how my personal curiosity in this field will prepare me for what the future lies ahead of me as a data science major.

## C++ Data Exploration
You can find my attempt of the C++ Data Exploration [code here](data_exploration.cpp) and the [document here](Assignment_#1.pdf).
