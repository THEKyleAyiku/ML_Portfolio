# ML_Portfolio
This portfolio is specifically for my senior-level college course entitled "Introduction to Machine Learning."

## Overview of Machine Learning
The Overview_of_ML PDF can be [found here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) for more details on what machine learning precisely is, how to utilize ML methods, and how my personal curiosity in this field will prepare me for what the future lies ahead of me as a Data Science major.

## C++ Data Exploration
You can find my attempt of the C++ Data Exploration [code here](data_exploration.cpp) and the [document here](Assignment_1.pdf).

## Linear Models
Linear regression is a technique which is utilized for predictions for variables which are based off of other variables. More information on how to utilize linear regression given a data set can be [found here](Regression.pdf) using the statistically designed language, R. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes on the other hand are not really regression algorithms, but are actually classification techniques as the target variables are qualitative and not quantitative. My rendition of an instance of what Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are can be [located here](Classification.pdf), with R being utilized again.

## C++ Algorithms from Scratch
I feel as though that C++ heavily inspired R to where the language is today. So during my class, I collaborated with a partner to code not one, but two C++ algorithms for Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Our attempt for the algorithms are located [code here](naive.cpp) and [more code here](logreg.cpp). Additionally, the document write up can be located [here](Assignment_4.pdf).

## Similarity & Ensemble
In another collaboration project, I worked with four of my classmates to create a four-notebook project which involved regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques to discover the similarities between these four types of techniques and also how they are utilizable for Machine Learning. The fifth member had to be a manager and essentially evaluate each and every single one of our parts to see if any of our notebooks could be imporved upon. In addition, my manager was prompted to write about each method in one document. I specifically worked on the regression portion of the project, so I was able to successfully perform Linear Regression and kNN Regression; for viewing my code in R, the algorithms and my analysis can be found [code here](Group_Project.Rmd) and my write-up can be found [here](Regression-3.pdf) as well. Also, my manager's document and my other collaborators' coding outputs and write-ups can be found below:

 Classification: [classification](Classification-1.pdf),
 Clustering: [clustering](Notebook_3_Clustering.pdf),
 Dimensionality Reduction: [dim_red.](Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf),
 Similarity & Ensemble Methods: [sim_ens](CS4375_Similarity_and_Ensemble_Team_Project.pdf).

## Ensemble Learning
For this R file, I implemented two ensemble methods called RandomForest and XGBoost to provide me with more practice regarding the topic of Machine Learning. The code can be located [here](Ensemble_Methods.Rmd) and the supportive write-up can be found [here](Ensemble_Methods-1.pdf).

## Python sklearn
This is my first introduction to the widely universe that is Python as I implemented data exploration, a neural network, Logistic Regression, etc. in order to gain some experience with Machine Learning for Python. The Python code can be found [here](sklearn_assignment(1).py).

## Image Classification
This is my attempt in trying to perform Image Classification in Python. The code can be found [here](image_classification.py).
